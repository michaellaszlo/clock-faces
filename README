# Clock faces

## Experimental clock faces combining rotary and digital design

A rotary clock face indicates a value&mdash;hour, minute, or
second&mdash;by pointing to its approximate location on a circle divided
according the value's unit of measure. A digital clock face states a
value with numerals.

What if we were to combine these two modes of expression? In other words,
why don't we state a value with numerals rendered at a location on a
circle? This would combine the virtues of the two display modes. The
location on the circle would express the value visually, and the numeric
expression would state the value explicitly.
